A unblocked games/website that is made by me, a 14 year old, Aiden Cisneros, also known as Sr. Bitt by some, and playtested and maintained by other 14 year olds that attend my school.
Currently do not know if the site is only available to chatham county schools, if it is, a clone will be released that is accesible to all.
A unblocked games and apps website that comes with a proxy. The games have a lot of variety, retro games to flash games to modern games are on the site. Even some google games such as Snake and Pac-Man.
The proxy is called CroxyProxy, and it can unblock mainly any website and game. From Tiktok to Shell Shockers.
Open to any criticism about the site.
